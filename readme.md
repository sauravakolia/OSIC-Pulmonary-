# OSIC-Pulmonary

This project, predicts a patientâ€™s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. lung function based on output from a spirometer is determined, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. The challenge is to use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.

**Approach Used**

For this project variational autoencoders are used.Using autoencoder we combined both the CT scans and tabular data.
